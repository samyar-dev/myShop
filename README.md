I am developing the backend of this project.\
I also use AI to design a simple frontend by explaining my ideas.\
I am interested in backend development because I like working with databases and controlling the logic behind websites.\
This project is built using Django and Python.\
Implemented basic AJAX/fetch functionality, focusing mainly on backend logic and API handling.\
